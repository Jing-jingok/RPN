# RPN
This is Region Proposal Network training example using VGG16 backbone with Pytorch

This is RPN netwrok training code example. Anchor box generation code is based on Guide to build Faster RCNN in PyTorch written by Prakashjay. I added training for arbitrary image size on top of it
Trainig data can be download from Pytorch tutorial page. or use this link [Penn-Fudan Database for Pedestrian Detection and Segmentation](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/ped_html/)

**contents**
For training use rpn.ipynb file.

**To do list**
- I will add validation code soon
- I will build complete Faster RCNN code using this RPN network
